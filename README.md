# Full Stack Toronto 2015 (maintained version by kxkl)
Empowering MicroServices With Apache Karaf.

This repository contains a demonstration of how Apache Karaf empowers Full Stack developers to design, develop, deploy micro service based architectues.

#Architecture:

Conceptually, there are four main services deployed in our container: a RESTful webservice handing incoming requests, a common library of objects, back end business processing logic, and a JMS broker. We mix and match these services together to build our stack.

#Prerequisites:

<pre><code>
JDK 11

Maven 3.2+

Apache Karaf 4.3.2

</code></pre>


#Installation:

Start a Karaf 4.3.2 instance, and execute the following commands:

<pre><code>
feature:repo-add mvn:com.savoirtech/feature/1.0.0/xml/features

feature:install fsto-deps

feature:install fsto-application 

</code></pre>

Restart karaf (to effect custom.system.properties which installed by Feature Bundle)


#Runtime:

Congratulations! You are likely reading this because you attended my session "Empowering MicroServices with Apache Karaf".  The presentation does an overview of building modular code on a use case for utilizing Camel to process an order with an online restful servive API that takes an order with multiple line items.  The end goal is to take this order and break down each line item to a specific manufacturer and send that order to each manufacturers processing locations. The business logic is broken down in several modules, such that we can swap out implementations as required. We then take advantage of Apache Karaf to simplify provisioning & deployment, add in custom interactions, and test integration of the stack!


The goal is to demonstrate building up on a use case that uses a restful service (JAXRS) that takes a JSON order, repsonds to the caller with an order accepted, and sending to via persistent messaging to EIPs using a splitter, messaging, and the file component.  The code demonstrates transofrmation from the original order into multiple individual orders based on the manufacturer of the widget (which is the beginning of the product name).


This project requires a tool that allows submission of Restful "POST" JSON payloads (IntelliJ, SOAPUI, Javascript). 

To build this project, run the following at the root of the project:
 
<pre><code>mvn clean install</code> </pre>

Follow the installation instructions above to deploy our built project into Apache Karaf.

In the Apache Karaf logs you should see something similar to this:

If you see these messages, then your ActiveMQ instance is not running or its not listening on port 61616 (or its not set up properly):

</code></pre>

Fixing ActiveMQ is beyond the scope of this, so if you can't get it you should chat with the folks over at ActiveMQ or Camel dev lists.

To execute the call to the restful service, besure that you set your tool/code/whatever to use the POST verb and point it to:

http://localhost:9090/rest/order/add/

Your payload should look something like this:

<pre><code>
{
  "order": {
    "customer": {
      "lastName": "Hessla",
      "firstName": "Heaf",
      "address": "1234 Main St",
      "city": "Jackson Hole",
      "state": "WY",
      "zip": "83001"
    },
    "items": [
      {
        "product": "abc widget",
        "quantity": 2
      },
      {
        "product": "xyz widget",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

You can copy and paste it from above or use the example.json in the root directory of this project.

To see the results, the target directoy (under Karaf root home folder) should have a manufacturers subdirectory in it.  That directory should have 2 additional sub direcorties in it, abc and xyz.  In those directories you will have file names in the format "order-yyyyMMddHHmmss.json".  These files and directories will appear after you successfully submit a properly formed json payload like the one shown above. The contents should look similar ot the following:

<pre><code>
{
  "customer" : {
    "lastName" : "Hessla",
    "firstName" : "Heaf",
    "address" : "1234 Miain St",
    "city" : "Jackson Hole",
    "state" : "WY",
    "zip" : "83001"
  },
  "product" : "abc widget",
  "quanitity" : 2
}
</code></pre>

The difference will mainly be in the product which should declare the xyz or abc widget depending on the manufacturer.
